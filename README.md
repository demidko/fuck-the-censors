# Fuck The Censors

The censorship bypass tool replaces Unicode characters with superficially identical characters from other code pages.
For example, "Censorship" looks like "Censorship", and "Text" looks like "Text", but they are actually different words
in terms of Unicode.

## Usage

The web app is available at [demidko.github.io/fuck-the-censors](https://demidko.github.io/fuck-the-censors) from any
device.
